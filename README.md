# SNES-Bung-Doctor-SF-III
The mainboard and memory board addon Kicad files for the Bung Game Doctor SF III. 

There were two bodged capacitors, 30 pF and 100 pF, that I've added footprints for on the PCB. I have also added a PLCC-32 footprint for the ROM. Everything else is original.

PCB Thicknesses: 1.6 mm
